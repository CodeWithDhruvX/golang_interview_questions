      "title": "How GOGC Works",
      "content": "The `GOGC` environment variable determines when garbage collection will run. The default value of `GOGC` is 100, which means GC will run when the heap size doubles. A higher value reduces GC frequency, but might lead to higher memory usage.",

This helps prevent issues like dangling pointers and memory leaks but comes with a slight performance cost due to the GC process.",
