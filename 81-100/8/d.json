      "content": "- Dependency Management: Automatically tracks and installs the required dependencies.\n- Versioning: Allows specifying exact versions for dependencies.\n- Offline Work: You can work without needing to fetch dependencies from the internet if theyâ€™re cached.\n- Easier Upgrades: Go modules provide a simple way to upgrade or downgrade dependencies.\n",

      "title": "How Go Mod Works",
      "content": "Go Mod works by creating a `go.mod` file in the root of your Go project. This file contains information about the modules you depend on, including their versions. The `go.sum` file keeps track of the exact cryptographic hash of each dependency to ensure integrity.\n\nWhen you run commands like `go build` or `go get`, Go will automatically update your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files as needed.",
