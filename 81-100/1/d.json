      "title": "Go's Memory Allocation: Heap vs Stack",
      "content": "Go manages memory using two main areas:\n\n1. **Stack Memory**: Used for local variables in functions. It's faster and more efficient but has limited space.\n2. **Heap Memory**: Used for dynamic memory allocation. It's slower but can grow in size as needed.",

      "title": "How Stack Memory Works in Go",
      "content": "The stack is used for function calls and local variables. It's managed by the **Go runtime** with a **stack pointer**. Each goroutine (Go's lightweight thread) has its own stack, which starts small and grows dynamically as needed.\n\nKey points:\n- Stack memory is automatically allocated when a function is called.\n- It is deallocated when the function returns.",

      "title": "How Heap Memory Works in Go",
      "content": "Heap memory is used when objects are created using the **new** or **make** functions, or when a variable's lifetime needs to extend beyond the scope of the function that created it.\n\n- **Heap allocation** is slower compared to stack allocation.\n- Memory in the heap is managed by the garbage collector.",

      "title": "Go Garbage Collection",
      "content": "Go uses an automatic **garbage collector (GC)** to clean up memory. The GC runs periodically to detect and reclaim unused memory, preventing memory leaks.\n\n- The GC identifies unreachable objects and frees their memory.\n- It's designed to have low latency to minimize its impact on performance.",

      "content": "Each goroutine has its own stack, which starts at a small size (e.g., 2 KB) and can grow dynamically. This stack management allows Go to handle many goroutines concurrently without running out of memory.\n\nKey points:\n- Goroutines are lightweight and use less memory than traditional threads.\n- Stack growth and shrinkage happen automatically based on usage.",

      "title": "Escape Analysis in Go",
      "content": "Go uses **escape analysis** to determine if a variable should be allocated on the heap or the stack. If a variable 'escapes' the function (e.g., it's returned), it will be allocated on the heap.\n\nThis process helps optimize memory allocation and improves performance.",
