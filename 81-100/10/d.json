      "content": "In Go, versioning helps ensure that your code dependencies remain stable and compatible across different environments. This is especially important as your application grows and evolves.\n\nGo modules, introduced in Go 1.11, provide a way to manage dependencies and their versions in a more structured manner. Understanding how to handle versioning in Go modules is essential for managing project dependencies effectively.",

      "title": "What is a Go Module?",
      "content": "A Go module is a collection of Go packages that are versioned together. It is defined by a `go.mod` file, which keeps track of the module's dependencies and their versions.\n\nThe module system helps manage third-party libraries and dependencies, ensuring compatibility by allowing you to specify versions of dependencies in your project.",

It contains metadata about your module, including its dependencies and their specific versions.\n\n### Example of a go.mod file:\n\n```go\nmodule example.com/myapp\n\ngo 1.18\n\nrequire (\n  github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.7.2\n  github.com/sirupsen/logrus v1.8.1\n)\n```",

Go resolves these conflicts by selecting the minimal version that satisfies all requirements.\n\nYou can also use `go get` to update or downgrade dependencies to specific versions if necessary.\n\n### Example:\n```bash\ngo get github.com/gin-gonic/gin@v1.7.5\n```",

To specify a pre-release version, use the `@` symbol followed by the version, such as `v1.2.3-beta`.\n3. A `major` version introduces breaking changes, a `minor` version adds features in a backward-compatible way, and a `patch` version fixes bugs without breaking anything.\n4.
