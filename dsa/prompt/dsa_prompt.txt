Please do a **DSA-style dry run** of the following code. I want the dry run as a **step-by-step narrated walkthrough** (NOT just a table). For each step, include: 1. **Step / Iteration number** 2. **Current line being executed** 3. **Variable values at this point** 4. **Data structure state** (array, stack, queue, recursion calls, pointers, etc. as applicable) 5. **Output so far** (if any) 6. A **simple explanation in plain words** of what is happening in that step. Continue this until the code finishes execution. At the end, also give me a **final summary** explaining what the whole code is doing overall in simple words. Here is the code: [PASTE YOUR CODE HERE]


package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sort"
)

// Greedy approach with dry run logging
func eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals [][]int) int {
	fmt.Println("📌 Input intervals:", intervals)

	if len(intervals) == 0 {
		return 0
	}

	// Step 1: Sort intervals by end time
	sort.Slice(intervals, func(i, j int) bool {
		return intervals[i][1] < intervals[j][1]
	})
	fmt.Println("\n🔹 After sorting by end time:", intervals)

	// Step 2: Pick the first interval
	count := 0
	prevEnd := intervals[0][1]
	fmt.Printf("👉 Start with interval %v, prevEnd = %d\n", intervals[0], prevEnd)

	// Step 3: Iterate and check overlaps
	for i := 1; i < len(intervals); i++ {
		curr := intervals[i]
		fmt.Printf("\nChecking interval %v: ", curr)

		if curr[0] < prevEnd {
			// Overlap → remove this interval
			count++
			fmt.Printf("❌ Overlaps with prevEnd=%d → Remove (total removed=%d)", prevEnd, count)
		} else {
			// No overlap → keep it
			prevEnd = curr[1]
			fmt.Printf("✅ No overlap → Keep, update prevEnd=%d", prevEnd)
		}
	}

	// Step 4: Result
	fmt.Printf("\n\n✅ Final Answer: Need to remove %d interval(s)\n", count)
	return count
}

func main() {
	// Example test case
	intervals := [][]int{{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}, {1, 3}}
	result := eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals)

	fmt.Println("\n📢 Output:", result)
}



I want you to act as a YouTube instructor teaching both junior and senior developers. I will provide a code snippet, and your job is to create a **step-by-step narrated walkthrough** explaining how the code works.  

The explanation should:  
- Be **simple and clear**, so juniors can understand.  
- Be **detailed enough**, with insights for seniors.  
- Be **engaging and conversational**, as if you are talking directly to the audience.  
- Include **step number**, **current line or action**, **variable values**, **data structure state** (stack, queue, recursion calls, etc.), and **what is happening in simple words**.  
- Explain **why** each step happens, not just what happens.  
- Include a **final summary** of the code, highlighting the overall logic and key takeaways.  

Do **not** include the code itself—focus only on the **steps and explanation**.
