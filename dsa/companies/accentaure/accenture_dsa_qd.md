Absolutely! I can categorize these problems into **beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels** for juniors based on the **difficulty, frequency, acceptance rate, and concepts involved**. Iâ€™ll focus on grouping by core concepts like Arrays, Strings, Math, Hash Table, Dynamic Programming, etc., which is very intuitive for junior developers.

## **Beginner Level (Easy, Fundamental Concepts)**

Focus: Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Simple Math, Two Pointers, Basic Linked List.

âœ… **Summary for Juniors:**

* **Beginner:** Focus on mastering Arrays, Strings, Hash Tables, Two Pointers, and simple Math.
* **Intermediate:** Build skills in DP, Binary Search, Sliding Window, Matrix, Greedy, and Stack.
* **Advanced:** Handle complex DP, Divide & Conquer, and algorithmic challenges with multiple concepts.

If you want, I can **make a visual roadmap for juniors** showing which concepts to learn first, with **problem progression from beginner â†’ advanced**. This makes it super clear what to practice first.

Do you want me to create that roadmap?
