## ⚠️ Things to keep in mind

* **LeetCode Premium** is needed for official company-tagged problems in many cases. Some repos scrape data assuming premium access. ([LeetCode][7])
* The lists are only as good / as updated as the maintainers. More recent interview questions may not yet be reflected.
* Tags are crowd-sourced / user added to some extent, so there could be inaccuracies.

If you want, I can share a **downloadable sheet** of “Top 50 problems asked by Amazon / Google / Microsoft” from public repos, so you can keep it offline. Do you want that?
