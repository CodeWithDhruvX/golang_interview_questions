It lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows for flexible and maintainable code by separating the algorithm implementation from the client that uses it.",

Strategies are defined in Go using interfaces. Concrete strategies implement this interface and provide specific implementations of the algorithm.\n\n3. The Context class holds a reference to a strategy and provides a method to switch strategies dynamically.\n\n4. Strategies can be switched dynamically by calling the `SetStrategy` method on the Context class and passing a different concrete strategy.\n\n5. One benefit of the Strategy Pattern is that it allows for easy extension by adding new strategies without modifying existing code.",
