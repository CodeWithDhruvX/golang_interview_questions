      "content": "In the Go example above, the `Client` struct depends on the `Service` interface. Instead of creating the `Service` directly inside the `Client`, we inject it into the `Client`'s constructor. This allows the `Client` to operate independently of the concrete `Service` implementation.\n\nKey Points:\n- The `Client` receives its dependencies (like `Service`) from outside.\n- This makes `Client` flexible and easy to test.\n",

They are simple functions that return an instance of a struct along with its dependencies.\n\nExample:\n\n```go\nfunc NewService() Service {\n    return &ServiceImpl{}\n}\n\nfunc NewClient(service Service) Client {\n    return Client{Service: service}\n}\n```\nThese constructor functions are used to assemble and inject dependencies at the time of object creation.",

This can help manage complex dependency graphs and simplify the application architecture.\n",
