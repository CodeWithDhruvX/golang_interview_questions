      "title": "Package Structure Overview",
      "content": "A reusable package typically has the following structure:\n\n- **src/**: Contains the source code\n- **tests/**: Contains unit tests for the package\n- **README.md**: Provides information about the package\n- **setup.py**: A script for installing the package\n- **LICENSE**: Specifies the terms of use",

      "title": "Creating a Modular Package",
      "content": "To create reusable code, break your code into **modular** components. Each module should focus on a single responsibility. For example, you could have separate modules for authentication, database handling, and file operations.",

    },
    {
      "title": "Use of Functions and Classes",
      "content": "When designing reusable code, make use of **functions** and **classes** to group related functionality. Functions should perform a single task, while classes can group related methods.\n\nExample:\n```python\nclass Database:\n    def connect(self):\n        pass\n    def execute_query(self, query):\n        pass\n```",

      "title": "Writing Clear Documentation",
      "content": "Clear documentation is crucial for reusable code. It should explain the purpose of each function, class, and method. Use **docstrings** in Python to document functions and methods.\n\nExample:\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n    def add(self, a, b):\n        \"\"\"Adds two numbers\"\"\"\n        return a + b\n```",

      "title": "Organizing Tests",
      "content": "You should organize tests to match the structure of your code. If you have a `database.py` file, create a `test_database.py` file with corresponding tests.\n\nExample directory structure:\n```\ntests/\n    test_database.py\n    test_authentication.py\n```",
