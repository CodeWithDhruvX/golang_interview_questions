      "content": "Go generics are a way to write flexible and reusable functions, types, and data structures. Prior to Go 1.18, Go lacked generics, meaning developers had to rely on type assertions or use the `interface{}` type for flexible code, which was often less type-safe. With generics, Go allows you to write functions and types that work with any data type while maintaining type safety.",

      "title": "Why Use Go Generics?",
      "content": "Generics help reduce code duplication, making your code more concise and maintainable. Instead of writing multiple functions to handle different types, you can write a single, reusable function or type that works with any type. Additionally, generics improve type safety, as the Go compiler can catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.",
