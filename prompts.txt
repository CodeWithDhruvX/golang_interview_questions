You are given a JSON array of slide objects. Each object contains:
- "title": which may have markdown formatting (like **bold**)
- "content": which may include markdown headers (like ###, ##)

Your task is to:
1. Strip all markdown formatting (such as **, *, ###, etc.) from both fields.
2. From the "content" field, extract plain text and assign it to "slide_topic".
3. From the "title" field, extract plain text and assign it to "title_text".
4. In "title_text", remove all non-alphabetic characters (keep only letters A–Z and a–z, and allow spaces).
5. Discard the rest of the fields.

Return a new JSON array where each object has only:
- "slide_topic": Use the first column (from content field)
- "title_text": Use the second column (from title field, alphabets and spaces only).

The result should be clean, plain-text only, and formatted as a JSON array.
