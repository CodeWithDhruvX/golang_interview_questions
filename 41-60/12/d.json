      "content": "The `interface{}` type is an empty interface in Go. It is a type that can hold any value, making it the most general type in Go.\n\n- **Definition**: `interface{}` is defined as a type with no methods.\n- **Usage**: You can store any value in an `interface{}` variable, but you need type assertion or type switch to extract the value.",

      "title": "What is any?",
      "content": "The `any` type is a more recent addition to Go (introduced in Go 1.18), and it is simply an alias for `interface{}`. While the underlying behavior is the same, the name `any` is more descriptive.\n\n- **Definition**: `any` is a new alias for `interface{}`.\n- **Usage**: The purpose of `any` is to make the code clearer and more readable by replacing `interface{}` in contexts where a value of any type is expected.",
