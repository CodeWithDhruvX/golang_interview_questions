Using a pointer allows the method to modify the actual data at the memory address, whereas using a value receiver works with a copy of the data.\n\n3. Yes, a value receiver can implement an interface as long as it provides the required methods. However, changes made to the data will not reflect outside the method.\n\n4. A pointer receiver allows modifications to the underlying data, while a value receiver works with a copy of the data and cannot modify the original data.",
