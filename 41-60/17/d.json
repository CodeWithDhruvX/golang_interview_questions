      "content": "In Go, an interface type is a contract that a type must implement. A **nil interface** is an interface value that does not contain any concrete value.

      "title": "How to Check for Nil Interface?",
      "content": "To check whether an interface is nil, you can use an explicit `== nil` check. However, you need to be careful because an interface with a concrete value of type `nil` isn't considered `nil` by the `== nil` check.\n\nExample:\n```go\nvar x interface{} = nil\nif x == nil {\n    fmt.Println(\"x is nil\")\n} else {\n    fmt.Println(\"x is not nil\")\n}\n```",
