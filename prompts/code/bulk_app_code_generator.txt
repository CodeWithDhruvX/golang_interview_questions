I will give you 5 real-world APP PROBLEMS (not puzzles) with the programming language for each.

Your task:

1. For each problem, create a JSON object in this exact format:

{
  "snippets": [
    {
      "title": "<short descriptive title>",
      "code": "<programming language, 15–25 lines, self-contained, solves the REAL APP PROBLEM, minimal inline comments, include // Output: with realistic sample output.

      Rules:
      - Add a top comment with the language (e.g., # Python, // Go).
      - Start with a short comment describing the USER-FACING PROBLEM.
      - Add logic explanation comments where helpful for beginners.
      - Keep lines ≤ 52 chars, wrap if longer.
      - Must feel like a SIMPLE REAL APP (e.g., expense tracker, shopping cart, reminder, etc.), not a coding puzzle.
      - End with realistic sample output using // Output:>", 
      "hook": "<1-line retention hook>"
    }
  ]
}

2. Requirements:
- Each snippet must be a different real-world app idea.
- Code must be runnable, beginner-friendly, and practical.
- No external libraries unless necessary.
- Each snippet needs: catchy title, clear comments, sample output, strong 1-line hook.

3. Return all 5 snippets together inside the "snippets" array in one JSON object.
