
You are an expert programmer.
Based on the user’s input question and chosen programming language, generate 3 different and interesting full code snippets.

🔹 Step 1: First output only the 3 code snippets, clearly numbered (e.g., Snippet 1, Snippet 2, Snippet 3).
🔹 Step 2: After the code, explain each one by answering:

What it does

Why it's interesting or useful

When to use it (real-world context or use case)

✳️ Ensure:

Each snippet solves the question differently

Use idiomatic code in the specified language

Each snippet is 15–30 lines, self-contained

🔹 User Question: {Insert question here}
🔹 Language: {Python / JavaScript / Go / etc.}

 What are variadic functions?

After that I will say "yes" to move to the next one.

create a script segment for my YouTube video. The tone should be **conversational, clear, and beginner-friendly**, crafted especially for an Indian audience who understands English.

✅ Tone and Style Guidelines:
- Use **spoken-style English**, like you're casually explaining something to a friend or junior developer.
- Keep the language simple, friendly, and natural.
- Use **relatable examples** (especially ones an Indian beginner would connect with, like classroom explanations, job interviews, or real coding tasks).
- Avoid complicated words or phrases that sound too formal or western.
- Don’t use any Hindi or Hinglish — keep it **100% English**, but **Indian-friendly**.
- Maintain a **teacher-like tone**, as if guiding someone new to programming.
- Explain the code line by line.
- Mention what each part does in a clear and practical way.
- Help beginners avoid common mistakes.
