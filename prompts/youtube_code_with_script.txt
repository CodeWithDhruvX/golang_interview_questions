
You are an expert programmer.
Based on the user’s input question and chosen programming language, generate 3 different and interesting full code snippets.

🔹 Step 1: First output only the 3 code snippets, clearly numbered (e.g., Snippet 1, Snippet 2, Snippet 3).
🔹 Step 2: After the code, explain each one by answering:

What it doess

Why it's interesting or useful

When to use it (real-world context or use case)

✳️ Ensure:

Each snippet solves the question differently

Use idiomatic code in the specified language

Each snippet is 15–30 lines, self-contained

🔹 User Question: {Insert question here}
🔹 Language: {Python / JavaScript / Go / etc.}

Can maps be compared directly in Go?

After that I will say "yes" to move to the next one.


"Generate a structured JSON Array for the 3 Singleton Code Snippets.
{ "videos": [ <put here all objects>]}
   The object should contain the following fields:

videoFile: Absolute file path of the video (e.g., "C:/Users/YourName/Videos/video.mp4").

title: A catchy title with emojis and keywords (e.g., "🚀 Master YouTube Automation with Python! (Step-by-Step Guide)") Don't add the snippet keyword.

description: A detailed video description with bullet points, emojis, and hashtags. make sure that it will follow youtube description box length

tags: A list of relevant tags related to the content.

categoryName: The category of the video (e.g., "Education").

privacyStatus: Either "private", "public", or "unlisted".

thumbnail: Absolute file path of the thumbnail image (e.g., "C:/Users/YourName/Videos/thumbnail.png").

playlistName: The playlist where this video should be added.

publishAt: Scheduled date and time in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.

madeForKids: Boolean value (true or false).

ageRestriction: Boolean value (true or false).

✅ Ensure:
For each of the following YouTube video titles or topics, generate:
- 1️⃣ A reworked, high-CTR YouTube **Title**
- 2️⃣ A **Thumbnail Text Hook** (2–4 words max, designed for visual impact)
- 3️⃣ An optional **Question-style Opening Hook** to use in video intro or caption.

🎯 Use these rules:
- Titles must create curiosity or tension. Use words like: “Why”, “How”, “Stop”, “Mistake”, “Breaks”, “Fix”, “Hidden”, etc.
- Use power emojis to enhance clarity (🔥, ❌, 🤯, 🧠, 🛑, etc.)
- Thumbnail text should be bold, visual, and minimal — as if it will be shown over a video image.
- Title is ≤100 characters.
- seo optimized title and description
- this is a short video

Please generate the

generate the thumbnail titles for the abov three code snippet for this format. please don't use the any speacial charcaters and emojis
and make sure that this below things
