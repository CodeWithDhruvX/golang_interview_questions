
You are an expert programmer.
Based on the user’s input question and chosen programming language, generate 3 different and interesting full code snippets.

🔹 Step 1: First output only the 3 code snippets, clearly numbered (e.g., Snippet 1, Snippet 2, Snippet 3).
🔹 Step 2: After the code, explain each one by answering:

What it doess

Why it's interesting or useful

When to use it (real-world context or use case)

✳️ Ensure:

Each snippet solves the question differently

Use idiomatic code in the specified language

Each snippet is 15–30 lines, self-contained

🔹 User Question: {Insert question here}
🔹 Language: {Python / JavaScript / Go / etc.}

 What is the difference between `new()` and `make()`?    in golang?

create a script segment for my YouTube video. The tone should be **conversational, clear, and beginner-friendly**, crafted especially for an Indian audience who understands English.

✅ Tone and Style Guidelines:
- Use **spoken-style English**, like you're casually explaining something to a friend or junior developer.
- Keep the language simple, friendly, and natural.
- Use **relatable examples** (especially ones an Indian beginner would connect with, like classroom explanations, job interviews, or real coding tasks).
- Avoid complicated words or phrases that sound too formal or western.
- Don’t use any Hindi or Hinglish — keep it **100% English**, but **Indian-friendly**.
- Maintain a **teacher-like tone**, as if guiding someone new to programming.
- Explain the code line by line.
- Mention what each part does in a clear and practical way.
- Help beginners avoid common mistakes.

"Generate a structured JSON Array for the 3 Singleton Code Snippets.
{ "videos": [ <put here all objects>]}
   The object should contain the following fields:

videoFile: Absolute file path of the video (e.g., "C:/Users/YourName/Videos/video.mp4").

title: A catchy title with emojis and keywords (e.g., "🚀 Master YouTube Automation with Python! (Step-by-Step Guide)") Don't add the snippet keyword.

description: A detailed video description with bullet points, emojis, and hashtags. make sure that it will follow youtube description box length

tags: A list of relevant tags related to the content.

categoryName: The category of the video (e.g., "Education").

privacyStatus: Either "private", "public", or "unlisted".

thumbnail: Absolute file path of the thumbnail image (e.g., "C:/Users/YourName/Videos/thumbnail.png").

playlistName: The playlist where this video should be added.

publishAt: Scheduled date and time in "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" format.

madeForKids: Boolean value (true or false).

✅ Ensure:
For each of the following YouTube video titles or topics, generate:
- 1️⃣ A reworked, high-CTR YouTube **Title**
- 2️⃣ A **Thumbnail Text Hook** (2–4 words max, designed for visual impact)
- 3️⃣ An optional **Question-style Opening Hook** to use in video intro or caption.

🎯 Use these rules:
- Titles must create curiosity or tension. Use words like: “Why”, “How”, “Stop”, “Mistake”, “Breaks”, “Fix”, “Hidden”, etc.
- Use power emojis to enhance clarity (🔥, ❌, 🤯, 🧠, 🛑, etc.)
- Thumbnail text should be bold, visual, and minimal — as if it will be shown over a video image.
- Title is ≤100 characters.
- seo optimized title and description
