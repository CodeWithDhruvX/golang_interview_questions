🎯 TASK:
You are to generate structured JSON data for multiple short-form videos (1–2 mins each) based on the list of topics I provide.

🧩 FORMAT:
For each topic in my input list, output:
{
  "topic": "<The topic name>",
  "slides": [
    {
      "title": "<Slide Title>",
      "content": "<Formatted content in markdown if text or raw if code>",
      "slide_type": "text" | "code" | "table"
    }
  ]
}

📏 RULES:
1. Exactly 4–5 slides per topic — optimized for fast-paced YouTube Shorts.
2. Slide 1 = Hook or myth to grab attention.
3. Final slide = Curiosity-based outro that hints at a follow-up.
4. Each slide must deliver **maximum value** in minimum time:
   - Use lists, emojis, **bold keywords**, and analogies.
   - Mix formats: **text**, **code**, or **table**.
5. Keep it beginner-friendly — avoid jargon.
6. All slides for all topics must be combined into one JSON array where each topic has its own `"slides"` array.

📱 USE CASE:
YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, LinkedIn Carousels.

💡 TONE:
Conversational, beginner-focused, and curiosity-driven.

🤖 STYLE:
"Explain like I’m 12, but make it viral."
