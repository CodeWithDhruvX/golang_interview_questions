I will provide a list of questions or topics. For each question:

1. Generate a YouTube video script.

2. Structure each script as follows:

   * Introduction: Include a introduction about the topic text.
   * Key Points: 3–5 main points, each with:

     * Bullet points for explanation
     * Diagram or visual placeholder (Mermaid or image placeholder)
       Example:
       graph showing step 1 → step 2 → step 3
     * On-screen text / narration cues in parentheses
   * Conclusion: Summary and call-to-action

3. Tone should be conversational, engaging, and easy to visualize.

4. Keep sentences short and suitable for narration.

5. Output all questions in a single file, each starting with a heading for the question/topic.

Input format example:

* Question 1: How does blockchain work?
* Question 2: What is quantum computing?
* Question 3: How do neural networks learn?

Output: One file with scripts, diagrams, and visual cues for all questions.
