‚úÖ FINAL YOUTUBE SCRIPT PROMPT (Hook-Driven + Retention-Boosting + Beginner-Friendly)

üîä TONE & STYLE ‚Äî TALK LIKE A FRIENDLY MENTOR
- Use spoken-style English ‚Äî imagine you're explaining this to a junior in college or someone prepping for interviews.
- Keep it super simple, natural, and clear ‚Äî avoid jargons or textbook words.
- Use relatable Indian examples (coding rounds, college viva, app building, freelance projects).
- No Hinglish. Keep it 100% English, but make it *feel Indian-friendly* ‚Äî like explaining over chai or in a canteen.
- Always assume the viewer is *hearing this for the first time*.

---

üé¨ INTRO SLIDE (Hook + Clear Promise)
üéô Use this for the **very first slide** of the video:

1. Start with a **hook or relatable pain point**:

2. Make a **clear promise**:
   - ‚ÄúBy the end of this video, you‚Äôll understand [topic] clearly, see 3 real code examples, and know where it‚Äôs used in real-world apps.‚Äù

3. Keep the tone energetic, inviting, and under **15‚Äì20 seconds**.

üìΩÔ∏è SLIDE-WISE SCRIPT STRUCTURE

üëâ FOR **TEXT / THEORY SLIDES**  
(Concept explanation, definitions, bullet points)

üéô Format:
- Read the slide title.
- Explain the idea like you're teaching a confused beginner in a classroom.
- Break down key terms in plain English.
- Use real-life analogies (e.g., ‚ÄúThink of this like how you‚Ä¶ in a Zomato app‚Ä¶‚Äù).
- Show how this concept is useful in:
  - Coding interviews
  - Real-world projects
  - Debugging or architecture

üìå End with:
> ‚ÄúThis sounds basic, but it's actually a building block for a lot of advanced topics ‚Äî especially when you're working on real apps.‚Äù

---

üëâ FOR **CODE SLIDES**  
(Code snippets, walkthroughs, demos)

üéô Format:
- Read the slide/snippet title.
- Go **line by line**, explaining what each part does.
- Avoid reading the code word-for-word ‚Äî instead, explain the **intention** behind each part.
- Use phrases like:
  - ‚ÄúHere we‚Äôre creating a function that...‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúThis line connects to the DB and checks if...‚Äù
- Relate to real-world examples:
  - ‚ÄúThis is exactly how login validation works in a MERN app.‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúIn a freelance project, you'd use this to format form data before submission.‚Äù

üö© Bonus:
- Point out 1 common beginner mistake or confusion here ‚Äî and clarify it.

üìå End with:
> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see this pattern again and again in interviews and projects ‚Äî so make sure this part is crystal clear.‚Äù

---

üëâ FOR **TABLE SLIDES**  
(Comparisons, pros & cons, differences)

üéô Format:
- Introduce the table and what it compares.
- Go **row by row**, breaking down each comparison.
- Explain which choice is better *and when*:
  - ‚ÄúIf you care about speed, choose X. But if you want flexibility, go with Y.‚Äù
- Add real use cases:
  - ‚ÄúIn startups, they usually pick this because...‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúIn product-based companies, this helps during scaling...‚Äù

üìå End with:
> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt memorize ‚Äî understand the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind each difference. That‚Äôs what interviewers really care about.‚Äù

üé¨ OUTRO SLIDE (Recap + Retention Trigger)
üéô Use this for the **final slide** of the video:

1. **Quick recap** of what they just learned:
   - ‚ÄúSo now you understand what [topic] is, how it works, and how to use it in real-world code.‚Äù

2. **Trigger curiosity** for the next video:
   - ‚ÄúIn the next video, we‚Äôll build a real feature using this ‚Äî like an actual signup system.‚Äù

3. **Reassure and encourage**:
   - ‚ÄúIf you understood this, you‚Äôre already ahead of most beginners. Keep going ‚Äî you‚Äôre doing great!‚Äù

‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT RULES (Apply to All Slides)
- No robotic tone ‚Äî speak naturally, like you're mentoring someone 1-on-1.
- No unnecessary intros or outros outside of the first/last slide.
- Don‚Äôt assume prior knowledge ‚Äî explain everything like it‚Äôs Day 1.
- End each slide with a **clear takeaway**.
- Keep your energy up ‚Äî your confidence = their attention.

You are an expert YouTube scriptwriter helping me create voiceover scripts for educational videos aimed at an English-speaking audience. Your job is to write a natural, engaging, and beginner-friendly voiceover script that sounds like a 1-on-1 mentor speaking to a curious learner.

Here‚Äôs what you MUST follow:

1. Use a **conversational tone**, like you're explaining to a friend.
2. Keep **sentences short and clear** ‚Äî max 15 words per sentence.
3. Add **pauses and rhythm** where needed ‚Äî use [pause] to show natural breaks.
4. Use **bold or CAPS** to mark emphasis for voice modulation.
5. Insert rhetorical or engaging questions like ‚ÄúWhy does this happen?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave you noticed this?‚Äù
6. Include **natural visual references** like ‚ÄúAs you can see here‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúLook at this part...‚Äù
7. Do NOT read slide text word-for-word ‚Äî always **paraphrase or simplify** in speech.
8. Keep the **pace around 100‚Äì130 words per minute.**
9. At the end, include a **gentle call-to-action** and a teaser for the next video.
10. Total word count: around 400‚Äì600 words for a 1‚Äì3 minute video.
11. don't use the any western or jargon words in the script
12. please stratight to the point. don't predict anything and dont say "i know" and "feeling like home"
13. add the outro at the end of the slide and don't say anything in upcoming video
14. please include human emotion in the script
15. please grab the attention in the first 30 second. this will must apply in the script

Input slide title or topic:
    {
      "title": "Introduction to Generics in Go",
      "content": "Generics in Go allow you to write functions, types, and data structures that can work with any data type, without sacrificing type safety. With the introduction of generics in Go 1.18, you can write more flexible and reusable code.",
      "slide_type": "text"
    },
    {
      "title": "What Are Structs in Go?",
      "content": "A struct in Go is a composite data type that groups variables (fields) together. Structs are used to represent real-world entities and store multiple related data points.",
      "slide_type": "text"
    },
    {
      "title": "Generics with Structs",
      "content": "Generics can be used with structs in Go to create data structures that can hold any type of value, providing more flexibility. You can define a generic struct that accepts any type as a type parameter.",
      "slide_type": "text"
    }

Now generate the full voiceover script with all of the above elements.


I have a list of slide objects in JSON format. After each slide, I will say "yes" to move to the next one.

Please generate the YouTube script (explainer format, in a natural, conversational tone for beginner programmers in India) for each object one by one.

After completing the all slide generate End with a warm, motivational outro encouraging viewers to subscribe.

Start with the first slide. Wait for me to say "yes" before moving to the next one.
