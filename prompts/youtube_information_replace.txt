I have two JSON inputs:

json1 – A list of objects, each containing a "videoFile" path.

json2 – A list of video metadata objects under the "videos" key. Each object has keys like "videoFile", "title", "description", "tags", "publishAt", etc.

🔄 Task:

Replace only the "videoFile" values in json2["videos"] with those from json1, in order.

Keep all other fields like title, description, tags, etc., unchanged.

🗓️ Additional Requirement:

Ask me for a starting date in format YYYY-MM-DD and playlist name.

Starting from that date, update the "publishAt" field for each video to be one per day, using fixed time 12:00:00.

Example: If I enter 2025-07-06, then:

First video → "publishAt": "2025-07-06 12:00:00"

Second video → "publishAt": "2025-07-07 12:00:00"

Third video → "publishAt": "2025-07-08 12:00:00"

…and so on.

⚠️ Rules:

If json1 has fewer items than json2["videos"], only replace what's available.

If json1 has more items, ignore the extra ones.

✅ Output:
Return the updated json2 JSON object with:

Replaced "videoFile" values

Updated "publishAt" values starting from the input date

All other properties preserved as-is
