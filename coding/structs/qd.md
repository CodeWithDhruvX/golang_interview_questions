Perfect — thanks for being specific! Since your focus is on **Go (Golang) interview Q\&A and pitfalls**, I’ll create **10 YouTube Shorts ideas** around your selected struct-related questions (#15–20). Each will have a killer hook, structure, titles/thumbnails, and one polished script.

# ✅ Part 1: 10 Viral YouTube Shorts Ideas (Go Structs)

### **Idea 1: "What are structs in Go?"**

* **Hook (0–3s):** “Classes don’t exist in Go — so how do you group data? 🤔”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → No classes in Go.
  * Solution → Use `struct`.
  * Tip → Show a `Person` struct example.
* **CTA:** “Comment your first Go struct below!”

---

### **Idea 2: "Struct Tags in Go Explained"**

* **Hook:** “This ONE line can break your Go code if you ignore it!”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Many beginners forget struct tags.
  * Solution → Show `json:"name"` tag example.
  * Tip → Explain tags affect encoding/decoding.
* **CTA:** “Save this for your next Go interview!”

---

### **Idea 3: "Embedding Structs in Go"**

* **Hook:** “Inheritance in Go? Not really… but here’s the trick!”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → No inheritance.
  * Solution → Use struct embedding.
  * Tip → Show `Employee` struct embedding `Person`.
* **CTA:** “Would you use composition over inheritance? Drop a 👍 or 👎.”

---

### **Idea 4: "Comparing Structs in Go"**

* **Hook:** “Did you know two structs in Go can be compared like THIS?”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → How to check if structs are equal?
  * Solution → Direct comparison only if fields are comparable.
  * Tip → Show quick code with `==`.
* **CTA:** “Tag a friend who struggles with Go syntax!”

---

### **Idea 5: "Shallow vs Deep Copy in Go"**

* **Hook:** “⚠️ Copying structs in Go isn’t always what you think…”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Assigning one struct to another only copies values.
  * Solution → Shallow copy vs manual deep copy.
  * Tip → Show example with slice inside struct.
* **CTA:** “Share this with a Go dev to save them hours!”

---

### **Idea 6: "Convert Struct to JSON in Go"**

* **Hook:** “Want to turn a Go struct into JSON in 1 line? Here’s how 👇”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Common interview Q.
  * Solution → Use `json.Marshal()`.
  * Tip → Remember struct tags for formatting.
* **CTA:** “Follow for more Go interview hacks!”

---

### **Idea 7: "Anonymous Structs in Go"**

* **Hook:** “Did you know you can create structs WITHOUT a name in Go?”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Sometimes you don’t need a named struct.
  * Solution → Anonymous struct syntax.
  * Tip → Useful in quick JSON handling.
* **CTA:** “Like if you just learned this today!”

---

### **Idea 8: "Exported vs Unexported Struct Fields"**

* **Hook:** “Why is your JSON empty? Here’s the #1 mistake in Go structs!”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Lowercase fields don’t export.
  * Solution → Capitalize field names.
  * Tip → Show `json.Marshal` with lowercase vs uppercase.
* **CTA:** “Comment ‘aha’ if this just saved you debugging time!”

---

### **Idea 9: "Nil Struct Pointers in Go"**

* **Hook:** “This Go bug will CRASH your program if you miss it 🚨”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Accessing a nil struct pointer.
  * Solution → Always check for nil.
  * Tip → Show safe pattern.
* **CTA:** “Tag a teammate who needs this reminder.”

---

### **Idea 10: "Memory Optimization with Structs in Go"**

* **Hook:** “Want to save memory in Go? Align your struct fields properly!”
* **Structure:**

  * Problem → Padding in structs wastes memory.
  * Solution → Group fields by type.
  * Tip → Show before vs after memory size.
* **CTA:** “Share this to flex your Go skills!”

# ✅ Part 2: 5 Titles & Thumbnails for Each (Sample for Idea 2)

### Idea 2: **Struct Tags in Go**

**Titles:**

1. “Go Struct Tags Explained in 30s 🚀”
2. “The #1 Beginner Mistake with Go Structs”
3. “Stop Breaking JSON in Go — Use Tags Right!”
4. “Go Interview Trick: Struct Tags Made Easy”
5. “Why is Your Go JSON Empty? FIX IT!”

**Thumbnail Text (Big, Bold, 2–3 words):**

* “STRUCT TAGS 🔑”
* “JSON BROKEN?”
* “GO HACK ⚡”
* “NO TAG = BUG”
* “INTERVIEW GOLD”

# ✅ Part 3: Full 30-Second Script (Highest Potential: Idea 2 – Struct Tags)

**\[0–3s Hook]:**
“Ever tried converting a struct to JSON in Go… and got an EMPTY result? 🚨”

**\[3–10s Problem]:**
“That’s because you forgot struct tags! Without them, Go doesn’t know how to map fields.”

**\[10–20s Solution]:**
“Example:

```go
type Person struct {
  Name string `json:"name"`
  Age  int    `json:"age"`
}
```

Now `json.Marshal()` works perfectly!”

**\[20–28s Quick Tip]:**
“Pro tip: Fields MUST be capitalized to be exported, or they won’t show in JSON at all.”

**\[28–30s CTA]:**
“Save this for your next Go interview — it’s a guaranteed question!”

# ✅ Part 4: Retention Optimization

* **Fast Pacing:** 3s hook → cut to example → pattern interrupt with JSON output.
* **Pattern Interrupts:** Switch between code snippet & real example output.
* **Loop:** Script ends with “guaranteed interview question,” making people rewatch.

---

# ✅ Part 5: Best Posting Strategy

* **Best Times (YouTube Shorts):**

  * Weekdays: **12 PM–2 PM EST** (lunch break) & **6–9 PM EST** (after work).
  * Weekends: **10 AM–12 PM EST** (late morning peak).

* **Test Strategy:**

  * Post 3x/week.
  * Track CTR (titles/thumbnails) + retention (watch %).
  * Double down on ideas with 80%+ retention.

* **Hashtags:**
  `#golang #interviewprep #codinginterview #golangstructs #godeveloper #techshorts #learncoding`
