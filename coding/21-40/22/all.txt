🔹 Snippet 1: Appending Single & Multiple Elements
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fruits := []string{"apple", "banana"}

    // Append a single element
    fruits = append(fruits, "cherry")

    // Append multiple elements
    fruits = append(fruits, "date", "elderberry")

    fmt.Println("Updated slice:", fruits)
}
🔹 Snippet 2: Appending Another Slice with Spread
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    base := []int{1, 2, 3}
    extra := []int{4, 5, 6}

    // Use spread operator to append all elements from extra
    base = append(base, extra...)

    fmt.Println("Combined slice:", base)
}
🔹 Snippet 3: Dynamically Building Slice with a Loop
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    var numbers []int

    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        numbers = append(numbers, i*i) // appending squares
    }

    fmt.Println("Dynamic slice:", numbers)
}
✅ Explanations
🔹 Snippet 1
What it does:
Shows basic use of append() to add one or multiple elements to a slice.

Why it's interesting:
This is the most idiomatic and flexible way to modify slices dynamically.

When to use it:
Whenever you want to grow a slice with new values during program execution — very common in real-world CRUD or input processing logic.

🔹 Snippet 2
What it does:
Demonstrates how to append another slice using the spread operator (...).

Why it's interesting:
It shows the cleanest way to merge slices, useful in aggregations or collecting results from multiple sources.

When to use it:
Ideal for combining inputs from different APIs, reading from multiple data sources, etc.

🔹 Snippet 3
What it does:
Illustrates how to build a slice dynamically inside a loop.

Why it's interesting:
It shows a performant, idiomatic Go way of slice expansion in loops — useful for computations or streaming values.

When to use it:
Use this pattern in algorithmic problems or when dynamically generating values during iteration.
