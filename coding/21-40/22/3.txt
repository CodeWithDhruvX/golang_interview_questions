SPOKEN:

Ever wondered how to build a list in Go that keeps growing as your program runs?
Like — you don’t know how many values you’ll have, but you want to keep adding as you go?
Then this is exactly what you need.

ON-SCREEN TEXT: “Build dynamic slices using append()”

SPOKEN:

Hey friends! 👋
In today’s video, we’ll learn how to dynamically build a slice in Golang using the append() function.
If you're just starting out with Go, this is a trick you’ll use all the time — from collecting inputs to building real-time data like a quiz scoreboard or user to-do list.
We’ll go line by line and explain it in the simplest way possible.
Ready? Let’s go!

📚 3. MAIN CONTENT
✅ Section 1: The Code Overview
[SCREEN RECORDING: Show VS Code or Go Playground with this code]

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var numbers []int

	for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
		numbers = append(numbers, i*i)
	}

	fmt.Println("Dynamic slice:", numbers)
}
🔍 Section 2: Line-by-Line Explanation
🧠 package main

This is where every Go program starts.
It tells the compiler, "Hey! This is an executable program."

📦 import "fmt"

We’re importing the fmt package so we can print stuff to the console.
Think of this as adding a basic “print” feature to your code.

📦 var numbers []int

This creates an empty slice of integers.
Think of it like an empty plate — ready to hold any number of items we put on it.

🔁 for i := 1; i <= 5; i++

We’re looping from 1 to 5.

🧮 i*i

We’re squaring the current number i.

📌 append(numbers, i*i)

This is the magic line.
Every time through the loop, we add the square of i into our growing slice.

🗣️ SPOKEN:

So we’re building this list step-by-step — starting from nothing and growing it dynamically with each loop.

🖨️ fmt.Println("Dynamic slice:", numbers)

This prints the final result: [1 4 9 16 25]
That’s just 1², 2², 3², and so on.

⚠️ Section 3: Common Mistake Alert
[ON-SCREEN TEXT: RED TEXT: "⚠️ Don’t forget to reassign!"]

Don’t forget: append() returns a new slice.
It doesn’t modify the old one in-place.
So if you don’t reassign the result, the slice won’t grow.

go
Copy
Edit
numbers = append(numbers, ...)
✅ Always do this reassignment, or you’ll wonder why your list is still empty!

💼 Section 4: Real-World Use Cases
[CAMERA: Speaking directly to the viewer, insert quick B-rolls or overlays for each use case]

So why should you care?
Well, in real life, you’ll use dynamic slices when:

🎯 Collecting user scores in a quiz app

🗃️ Storing query results from a database

📝 Building a to-do list while a user types

You won’t always know in advance how many values you’ll need — and that’s exactly when append() becomes your best friend.

💡 Section 5: Quick Recap
[ON-SCREEN TEXT: Checklist with checkmark animations]

So let’s quickly recap what we learned today:

✅ Declare an empty slice
✅ Use a loop or condition to append() values
✅ Always assign the result back to the original slice variable
