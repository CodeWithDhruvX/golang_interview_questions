"Ever tried merging two lists in Go and wondered — why do we need these three dots? What does extra... even mean? 🤯
Today, I’ll show you a powerful little trick in Go — the spread operator — that’ll save you tons of headache when working with slices!"

🎙️ 0:15–0:45 — Intro
Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel!
If you're learning Go or working on coding assignments, you’ve probably used append() — but did you know there's a smart way to combine two slices with just three dots?

In this video, I’ll explain what the spread operator ... does, why it’s used in append(), and how you can avoid a very common mistake that beginners make.

Let’s break it down step by step with a simple real-world example.
💻 0:45–2:30 — Code Walkthrough
go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	base := []int{1, 2, 3}
	extra := []int{4, 5, 6}

	// Use spread operator to append all elements from extra
	base = append(base, extra...)

	fmt.Println("Combined slice:", base)
}
🧠 Let's break this down line by line:
Line 1: package main

This tells Go that we’re writing a standalone program — kind of like saying “this is the main dish, not a side dish.”

Line 3: import "fmt"

We’re importing the fmt package — short for "format" — which helps us print stuff to the terminal.
Think of it as Go’s built-in speaker to talk to the user.

Line 5: func main() {

The main() function is where the party starts. This is the entry point — the first thing that runs in your program.

Line 6: base := []int{1, 2, 3}

Here we’re creating a slice called base.
Imagine this as your base plate in a buffet — it already has 3 items: 1, 2, and 3.

Line 7: extra := []int{4, 5, 6}

This is another slice — extra. Think of this like a second plate of food that we want to combine with the first one.

Line 9: base = append(base, extra...)

Here’s where the magic happens 👇

The append() function is used to add items to a slice.

But you can’t just write append(base, extra) — that would treat extra as one item, not a list of items.

That’s why we use extra... — this spreads out the slice so that 4, 5, 6 get added individually, not as a single block.

In simple words:
extra... means “take all the values inside extra and pass them one by one.”

Line 11: fmt.Println("Combined slice:", base)

Now we print the result. The output will be:

less
Copy
Edit
Combined slice: [1 2 3 4 5 6]
Perfectly combined!

🚫 Common Beginner Mistake
If you forget those three dots and just write append(base, extra), Go will give you an error:

"cannot use extra (type []int) as type int in append"

So always remember:
When you want to merge two slices in Go, you need to spread the second one with ...

📌 Real-World Example
Imagine you’re building a feature where you load a list of default users and then want to add more from a config file — this trick helps you merge both lists cleanly.

It’s super useful in API data processing, JSON parsing, and even building simple CLI apps.

And that’s it! 🎉
You now understand how the spread operator works in Go with append() — and why those three dots are more powerful than they look.
