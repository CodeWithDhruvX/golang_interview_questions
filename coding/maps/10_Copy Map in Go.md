Got it âœ… Iâ€™ll take your given snippet and turn it into a **full YouTube script** (beginner-friendly, 1.5â€“3 min) with the structure you requested. Since you said max 3 per batch, hereâ€™s the **first script** for your provided problem + solution.

### 1. Copying Maps in Go

**Opening Hook (0:00â€“0:10)**
"Think copying a map in Go is as simple as using `=`? \[pause] Wrong! What youâ€™re actually doing might surprise you â€” and it could break your code in production."

**Concept Explanation (0:10â€“0:40)**
"In Go, maps are reference types. That means when you assign one map to another, youâ€™re not creating a brand-new copy. Instead, both variables point to the same underlying data. So, if you change one, the other changes too! \[pause] And that can lead to sneaky bugs if youâ€™re expecting them to be separate."

**Code Walkthrough (0:40â€“1:20)**
(show problem code on screen)
"Hereâ€™s the problem: we create `map1` with keys `'a'` and `'b'`. Then we write `map2 := map1`. It looks like a copyâ€¦ but itâ€™s not. When we update `map2["a"]` to `100`, guess what? `map1["a"]` also changes. And the output confirms it â€” both maps now show `'a': 100`. Ouch."

(show solution code on screen)
"So how do we actually make a copy? Simple. Create a new map, `map2 := make(map[string]int)`, then loop over `map1` and copy each key-value pair. Now when we change `map2["a"]`, only `map2` is affected. And printing them shows the difference â€” `map1` stays untouched."

**Why Itâ€™s Useful (1:20â€“2:10)**
"This is super important in real-world Go projects. Imagine you have a config map, or cached data, and you want to work with a copy without messing up the original. If you just assign, youâ€™ll accidentally overwrite the original values. But if you do a deep copy like this, you keep both maps independent. \[pause] Itâ€™s a small trick, but it saves you from some very nasty bugs."

**Outro (2:10â€“2:30)**
"So â€” did you think `map2 := map1` created a new map before watching this? \[pause] Drop your answer in the comments. And if you found this tip helpful, hit like, subscribe, and stick around for more Go interview pitfalls explained the easy way."

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to now generate scripts for **2 more snippets** (like your other Go map/concurrency examples), so we complete this batch of 3?
