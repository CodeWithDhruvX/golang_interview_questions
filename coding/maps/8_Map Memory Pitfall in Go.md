1. Hook (0:00â€“0:12)

[Close-up, excited tone]
"Did you know that in Go, deleting something from a map doesnâ€™t always free memory? ðŸ¤¯ Let me show you why, in a way even beginners can understand."

2. Intro (0:12â€“0:35)

[Cut to slide/code snippet]
"Hey friends! Today weâ€™ll explore Goâ€™s memory behavior with maps. Many assume delete(m, key) instantly frees memory. But Go works differently. By the end, youâ€™ll see why memory sometimes sticks around and how to reclaim it safely."

3. Main Content
Section 1: Memory Tracker

[Show printMem function]
"This small helper prints memory usage at each step. Think of it like checking your phoneâ€™s storage after installing or deleting apps. Youâ€™ll see exactly whatâ€™s happening."

Section 2: Allocating Memory

[Highlight: m[1] = new([1 << 20]byte) + printMem]
"We allocate a 1MB object in the map. Memory jumps from ~193 KB to ~1220 KB â€” as expected. Weâ€™re storing data, so Go reserves space."

Section 3: Delete Only

[Show: delete(m, 1) + runtime.GC()]
"Now, we delete the map entry. Youâ€™d expect memory to drop back, right? [pause] But no! Memory barely changes (~206 KB). Why? Because the map still held a reference. Itâ€™s like removing a name from a list, but the person is still sitting there!"

Section 4: Break Reference + Delete

[Highlight: m[1] = nil + delete(m, 1) + runtime.GC()]
"To truly free memory, first break the reference: m[1] = nil. Then delete the entry. Memory now drops (~211 KB). Garbage collector can finally reclaim it. Many beginners miss this key step!"

Section 5: Practical Analogy

"Think of a classroom: removing a student from the list doesnâ€™t empty the chair. Only when the chair is cleared (reference broken) can someone else use it. Thatâ€™s Goâ€™s garbage collector in action."

4. Call-to-Action

[Presenter facing camera]
"If this helped, hit like and comment your memory woes in Go! Sharing your story helps others learn too."

5. Outro

"So the takeaway is simple: deleting from a map â‰  freeing memory. Break references first, then delete. Keep this in mind with big data in Go. Donâ€™t forget to subscribe for more beginner-friendly tips!"

Simplified Code Snippet (Practical & Short)
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func printMem(stage string) {
	var m runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&m)
	fmt.Printf("%-20s Alloc = %d KB\n", stage, m.Alloc/1024)
}

func main() {
	printMem("Start")

	m := map[int]*[1<<20]byte{} // 1MB object
	m[1] = new([1<<20]byte)
	printMem("After alloc 1MB")

	// Case 1: delete only
	delete(m, 1)
	runtime.GC()
	printMem("After delete only")

	// Case 2: break reference + delete
	m[1] = new([1<<20]byte)
	printMem("After 2nd alloc")
	m[1] = nil // break reference
	delete(m, 1)
	runtime.GC()
	printMem("After break+delete")
}


Output (example)

Start                Alloc = 193 KB
After alloc 1MB      Alloc = 1220 KB
After delete only    Alloc = 206 KB
After 2nd alloc      Alloc = 1233 KB
After break+delete   Alloc = 211 KB


âœ… Key point: breaking the reference is crucial for GC to reclaim memory.
