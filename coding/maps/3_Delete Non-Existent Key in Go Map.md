# Delete Non-Existent Key in Go Map

3. Delete Non-Existent Key in Go Map

Opening Hook (0:00â€“0:10)
"What happens if you delete a key from a map that doesnâ€™t exist in Go? [pause] Does it panic? Does it error out? Letâ€™s find out."

Concept Explanation (0:10â€“0:40)
"In some languages, trying to delete a missing key can cause errors or exceptions. But Go is different. Go takes a safer approachâ€”it just ignores the delete request. That means you donâ€™t have to worry about your program crashing if the key isnâ€™t found."

Code Walkthrough (0:40â€“1:20)
"(show code)
We create a map m := map[string]int{\"x\": 10} with one key 'x'.
Next, we try to delete(m, \"y\"). But waitâ€”thereâ€™s no 'y' in this map. Instead of throwing an error, Go silently does nothing.
Finally, fmt.Println(m) prints out map[x:10]. The map remains unchanged."

Why Itâ€™s Useful (1:20â€“2:10)
"This makes Go very beginner-friendly and safe to use in production. [pause] You donâ€™t need to write extra checks like â€˜if key exists, then deleteâ€™. You can just call delete directly. Thatâ€™s especially helpful in cleanup logic, caching systems, or when processing user dataâ€”because you can confidently delete keys without worrying about errors."

Outro (2:10â€“2:30)
