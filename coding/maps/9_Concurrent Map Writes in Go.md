# Concurrent Map Writes in Go

9. Concurrent Map Writes in Go

Opening Hook (0:00–0:10)
"Ever seen this scary error in Go: [pause] fatal error: concurrent map writes? Let’s talk about why it happens and how to fix it."

Concept Explanation (0:10–0:40)
"Go maps are not thread-safe. That means if two goroutines try to write to a map at the same time, Go will panic with that error. This is by design—to force developers to think about concurrency safety."

Code Walkthrough (0:40–1:20)
"(show code)
Instead of using a plain map, we use sync.Map from the standard library.
We declare var m sync.Map.
Then we call m.Store(\"a\", 1) to add a key-value pair.
We retrieve it with m.Load(\"a\"), and printing the value gives 1.
Unlike regular maps, sync.Map is built to handle concurrent access safely."

Why It’s Useful (1:20–2:10)
"This is huge in real-world Go applications. [pause] Think about caching, shared state in goroutines, or high-performance web servers. If multiple goroutines are writing to a regular map, you’ll crash. With sync.Map or by wrapping maps with sync.Mutex, you ensure your program is safe and stable."
