## **ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Monetization & Growth Strategy**

* **Batch-Friendly Themes for Faster Production** :
* **"Interview Gotcha" Week** : Film all the Shorts that focus on common mistakes (comparing maps, `len` vs `cap`, slice copy issues). This creates a high-urgency, cohesive theme that's easy to binge.
* **"Data Structures 101" Week** : Batch the introductory Shorts for each topic (`What is a slice?`, `What is a map?`, `What is a struct?`). This is perfect for attracting and converting new learners.
* **"Deep Dive" Day** : Dedicate one day per week to scripting and recording only the long-form videos. They require more focus, and batching them separately improves quality.
* **Content Repurposing Flywheel (to maximize reach)** :
* **Shorts â†’ LinkedIn Carousels / Twitter Threads** : A 60-second Short provides a perfect script for a 5-slide LinkedIn carousel or a viral Twitter thread. Post the native video, then post the repurposed content a day later linking back to the original video.
* **Long-form â†’ Blog Posts / Medium Articles** : A 10-minute video on a topic like "Shallow vs. Deep Copy" can be easily transcribed and edited into a detailed blog post. Embed the YouTube video in the article to improve SEO and provide more value.
* **Playlist â†’ Free Mini-Course / Community Challenge** : Once a playlist like "Go Slices & Arrays Mastery" is complete, package it as a "Free 5-Day Go Slice Challenge" for your email list or Discord community. This is a powerful way to build your audience and authority off-platform.
