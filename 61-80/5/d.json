      "title": "Why Close a Channel?",
      "content": "Closing a channel in Go is important to signal that no more values will be sent through it. This helps goroutines that are receiving from the channel to stop waiting for values and gracefully finish processing.",

      "title": "Example: Closing a Channel",
      "content": "In this example, we create a goroutine that sends data to a channel, and then we close the channel after sending all values.\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n    ch := make(chan int)\n\n    go func() {\n        for i := 1; i <= 3; i++ {\n            ch <- i\n        }\n        close(ch) // Close the channel after sending data\n    }()\n\n    for val := range ch {\n        fmt.Println(val)\n    }\n}\n```",
