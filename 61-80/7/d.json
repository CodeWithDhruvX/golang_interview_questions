      "content": "A **channel** in Go allows communication between goroutines. It acts like a pipeline where one goroutine sends data, and another receives it.\n\nWhen a channel is closed, the receiver can detect it to stop further operations. This is essential for managing resources and ensuring that your program doesnâ€™t hang indefinitely.",

If you receive from a closed channel without checking `ok`, you'll get the last value sent, but it will block indefinitely after that.\n\n4. You should only close a channel once to prevent runtime panics from attempting to close an already closed channel.",
