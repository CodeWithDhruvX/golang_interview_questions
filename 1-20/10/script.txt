Alright, let’s talk about for loops in Go.

So in many programming languages, you’ve got different types of loops — like for, while, and even do-while. But in Go, things are simpler. There's just one loop keyword — for. That’s it. But don’t worry — this one for loop can do everything that the others do.

You can use it like a regular for loop — say, when you want to run something a fixed number of times, like printing numbers from 1 to 10. You can also use it like a while loop, where you keep running some logic until a condition is met — like reading input until the user types “exit”. And yeah, you can even make it run forever — that’s called an infinite loop. Super useful when you’re building something like a server or a background process that keeps running.

So the Go for loop is versatile and powerful — and once you get comfortable with it, you’ll use it all the time in your code — whether it’s for simple tasks, or real-world stuff like reading files, handling user input, or working with APIs.

Let’s now break it down step by step in the upcoming slides.



=============================================================================================


🎙️ Slide: "Basic For Loop Syntax"

Now let’s look at the basic structure of a for loop in Go.

You’ll usually see it written like this:

go
Copy
Edit
for initialization; condition; post {
    // code to execute
}
Let’s break this down, nice and easy.

Initialization is where you start your loop. Usually, you’ll declare and set a counter variable. Something like i := 0.

Then comes the condition — this is checked before every loop. If it’s true, the loop continues. If it’s false, the loop stops. For example, i < 5 means “keep looping until i reaches 5”.

The post part runs after each loop. Most commonly, we use it to update the counter — like i++, which means “increase i by 1”.

Inside the curly braces { }, we write whatever code we want to repeat. Could be printing something, doing calculations, whatever the task is.

So in simple terms:
Start → Check → Do Work → Update → Repeat… until the condition fails.

This format is really helpful for doing things like printing a table of numbers, going through an array, or repeating a task a set number of times — which, honestly, comes up all the time in coding interviews and real-life development.

One quick tip: don’t forget the semicolons ; between these three parts. That’s a common mistake when you're new to Go.

Alright, now let’s see how this looks in a real example in the next slide.



=============================================================================================================



🎙️ Slide: "For Loop Example 1: Counting from 1 to 5"

Let’s now look at a super simple example — we’re just printing numbers from 1 to 5.

Here’s the code:

go
Copy
Edit
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
Let’s walk through it line by line.

First, we’ve got package main. This just tells Go that this is the starting point of your program.

Then import "fmt" — this is how we bring in the fmt package, which gives us the Println function we’ll use to display things on the screen.

Now, func main() — this is the main function where Go starts running your code. Every Go program starts from main().

Inside that, we’ve got the for loop:

i := 1 means we’re starting with the value 1.

i <= 5 is our condition. So the loop will run as long as i is less than or equal to 5.

i++ means we increase the value of i by 1 after every loop.

And finally, fmt.Println(i) just prints the current value of i.

So the output will be:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
3  
4  
5
That’s it — a clean, simple loop to count from 1 to 5.

You’ll see this kind of loop all the time — whether you’re looping through data, generating serial numbers, or just practicing patterns in college assignments.

One thing to remember: if you accidentally write i < 5 instead of i <= 5, you’ll only get 1 to 4 — not 1 to 5. So be careful with your condition.

Alright, now that you’ve seen this basic example, let’s move to the next one.




============================================================================================


Alright, here’s something interesting.

In Go, there’s no separate while loop like in some other languages — but you can still use a for loop like a while loop. Let’s see how that works with this example.

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    i := 1
    for i <= 5 {
        fmt.Println(i)
        i++
    }
}
Let me explain this line by line.

First, package main and import "fmt" — these are the usual setup lines for a Go program.

Inside main(), we start by writing i := 1. So, we’re initializing i with the value 1 before the loop.

Now comes the actual for loop:

The loop is written as for i <= 5. This is the condition part only — there's no initialization or post update inside the loop line.

What this means is: as long as i is less than or equal to 5, keep running the loop.

Inside the loop, we print the value of i with fmt.Println(i), and then do i++ to increase it by 1.

So again, this will print:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
3  
4  
5
It works just like the previous loop, but now we’ve split up the setup — the initialization is outside, the condition is in the for, and the increment is inside the loop.

This pattern is super useful when you don’t always know how many times something will run — like waiting for user input, or checking if a file exists.

So yeah — in Go, if you ever need a while loop, just use for with only a condition. Clean and simple!

Let’s now look at another variation in the next slide.





===========================================================================================================


Now let’s look at something a little different — the infinite loop.

In Go, if you just write for without giving any condition, it becomes an infinite loop — meaning, it will keep running forever until you manually stop it. Sounds scary, but it’s actually quite useful in many real-world cases, like servers or background tasks that should keep running until we tell them to stop.

Let’s see the example:

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for {
        fmt.Println("This is an infinite loop")
        break
    }
}
Alright, line by line:

We’ve got the usual package main and import "fmt" — that’s our basic setup.

Inside main(), the key line is just for {.
No initialization, no condition, no post statement — just for and curly braces.

That tells Go: “Keep looping… forever.”

Inside the loop, we print: "This is an infinite loop".

And then comes the break statement. This is very important. It tells Go: “Okay, stop the loop now.”

So even though the loop is infinite by design, we're controlling when to exit using break.

This kind of loop is super useful when you don’t know how many times something needs to repeat, or when you're waiting for some external event — like user input, or a message from a server. You just keep looping, and break when you're ready.

But quick warning — if you forget the break, the loop will never end, and your program will keep running forever, which can crash your app or hang your terminal. So be careful.

Alright, let’s move on and explore more about how Go handles loops in different styles.




=========================================================================================================



Now let’s talk about how to control the flow inside a for loop using two important keywords — break and continue.

These are super useful when you want to either stop the loop completely, or just skip one particular step.

Let’s go through this example:

go
Copy
Edit
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
        if i == 3 {
            continue
        }
        if i == 5 {
            break
        }
        fmt.Println(i)
    }
}
Alright — let’s break this down step by step.

First, as always, we start with the main function and a for loop that runs from 1 to 5.

Inside the loop, we have two conditions:

if i == 3 { continue }
This means: “If the value of i is 3, skip this iteration — don’t run the fmt.Println, just jump to the next number.”
So 3 won’t get printed at all.

if i == 5 { break }
This means: “If i reaches 5, then stop the loop entirely — don’t even check the next numbers.”

The fmt.Println(i) only runs if neither of those if conditions are true.

So what gets printed?

Let’s walk it through:

i = 1 → prints 1

i = 2 → prints 2

i = 3 → skipped because of continue

i = 4 → prints 4

i = 5 → loop breaks, nothing more runs

So the output will be:

Copy
Edit
1  
2  
4
Now, why is this important?

Well, in real-world code — let’s say you’re looping through user data, or reading from a file — you might want to skip invalid values using continue, or exit early using break if some condition is met.

It makes your loops smarter and more efficient, instead of just blindly running start to end.

Alright, now that you understand how to break and continue a loop — let’s move ahead!




===================================================================================================


🎙️ Slide: "For Loop vs Other Loops"

So here’s something unique about Go.

Unlike languages like C, Java, or Python — where you’ve got multiple loop types like for, while, and do-while — Go keeps it really simple. It gives you just one looping keyword, and that is — for.

But the cool part is: this one for loop is super flexible. You can use it in three different ways, depending on what you need.

Let’s quickly look at them:

First, we’ve got the classic format:
for initialization; condition; post
This is your regular loop — like counting from 1 to 10. Very useful when you know exactly how many times to run something.

Next is the condition-only version:
for condition
This works just like a while loop in other languages. You set up the variable outside the loop, and just keep looping while the condition is true. Super handy when you don’t know in advance how many times the loop will run — like waiting for a user to press a key or checking if a file exists.

And finally, there’s the infinite loop:
for with nothing else — just the word for.
This will run forever unless you use a break inside it. It’s used in things like servers or background tasks that need to keep running until something tells them to stop.

So in short:
Instead of having three different loop keywords, Go gives you one smart loop that does the job of all three.

This makes your code simpler and cleaner, and once you get comfortable with it, you’ll actually enjoy how consistent it feels.

Let’s now wrap things up or explore more in the next slide.





================================================================================================



🎙️ Slide: "For Loop in Table Format"

Alright, let’s quickly review what we’ve learned so far — but this time in a neat table format.
This slide shows you the three common ways to use the for loop in Go, side by side.

Let’s go through them one by one:

🟢 1. Traditional For Loop

go
Copy
Edit
for i := 1; i <= 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}
This one is your classic for loop — it has all three parts: initialization, condition, and post update.
Perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.
Think of it like printing 1 to 5, or processing the first 10 records in a list.

🟡 2. While Loop Style

go
Copy
Edit
i := 1
for i <= 5 {
    fmt.Println(i)
    i++
}
This is Go’s version of a while loop — just the condition inside for, and the rest handled manually.
You’ll use this style when you want to loop based on a condition, and not a fixed number of times.
For example: keep asking a user for input until they type “exit”.

🔴 3. Infinite Loop

go
Copy
Edit
for {
    fmt.Println("Infinite loop")
    break
}
Now this one looks scary, but it’s very useful.

This is an infinite loop — it keeps running forever unless you stop it with something like break.
Used a lot in real-world Go programs, like web servers or background workers that need to keep running.

So overall, Go gives you just one loop keyword — for, but with three powerful patterns.

Understanding these three styles will help you pick the right loop for the right situation in your programs.

Let’s keep going and explore more ways to work with loops in Go!





====================================================================================================



Alright, let’s wrap it up with one simple thought:

The for loop in Go is actually one of the most powerful tools in your Go programming journey.
Even though Go doesn’t give you multiple loop types like some other languages, the way it handles for is super flexible — and once you get used to it, you’ll be able to handle almost any looping requirement with just this one keyword.

Whether you’re doing something as simple as counting from 1 to 10, or handling complex tasks like looping through data from a file or waiting for input in a long-running program — you’ll rely on for a lot.

And here’s the key point:
If you understand these three styles — traditional, while-style, and infinite — you’re already ahead of many beginners.

So keep practicing with small examples — like printing patterns, solving basic problems, or writing simple automation scripts.

Mastering the for loop early on will really boost your confidence when you start building real Go programs.

Let’s keep learning!
