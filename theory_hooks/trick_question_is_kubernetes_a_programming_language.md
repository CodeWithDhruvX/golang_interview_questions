### Trick Question: Is Kubernetes a Programming Language?

**Answer:** No. Kubernetes is an **orchestration platform**, not a programming language.

- **Role:** Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
- **Misconception:** Some think Kubernetes is like Python or Java. It's not â€” it's an infrastructure management tool.

**Interview Tip:** Answer confidently: *"No. Kubernetes is an orchestration tool for containers, not a language."*

**Pitfall:** Don't just say "No." Explain what it actually is.
