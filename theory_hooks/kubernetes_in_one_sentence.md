### Kubernetes in One Sentence

Kubernetes is **the operating system for containers** â€” it automates running, scaling, and managing containerized apps.

- **Analogy:** Like a conductor orchestrating many instruments, Kubernetes coordinates many containers.
- **Interview Tip:** Keep it one line: *"Kubernetes = Orchestrator for containers."*

**Pitfall:** Avoid drowning in jargon. One crisp analogy is better than long technical detail.
