### Kubernetes Pitfall: Overcomplicating Answers

**Common mistake:** Candidates overload answers with jargon: etcd, kubelet, ingress, scheduler.

**Correct Approach:**
- Use a simple 3-step structure: **Definition → Purpose → Analogy**.
- Example: *"Kubernetes is a container orchestrator. It automates scaling and healing. Think autopilot for containers."*

**Pitfall:** Don't try to impress by listing every component — clarity beats detail.
