### Pod Analogy That Always Works

A Pod is like a **box** that can hold one or more toys (containers). Wherever the box goes, the toys go together.

- **Pod = wrapper for containers**
- **Example:**
  - One Pod can contain: web server + logging sidecar

**Interview Tip:** Use analogies for clarity. Many interviewers value simple explanations.

**Pitfall:** Don't skip that Pods can hold multiple containers, not just one.
