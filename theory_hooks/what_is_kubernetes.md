### What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an open-source **container orchestration platform**. It automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

- **Core Idea:** Instead of manually managing containers, Kubernetes schedules, monitors, and heals them across clusters of machines.
- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic scaling
  - Load balancing
  - Self-healing (restart failed containers)
  - Declarative configuration

**Pitfall:** Many candidates overcomplicate this definition. Keep it simple: *Kubernetes = Operating system for containers.*
