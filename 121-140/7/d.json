Provide an example.**\n  You can use interfaces as constraints for generic types to restrict the types that can be passed into a function. Example:\n  ```go\n  func Sum[T Adder](a T, x, y int) int {\n      return a.Add(x, y)\n  }\n  ```\n\n- **What is a common pitfall when using interfaces with generics in Go?**\n  Using the empty interface (`interface{}`) as a generic type can lead to less type safety and can be harder to work with.",
