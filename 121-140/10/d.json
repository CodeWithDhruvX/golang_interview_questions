      "content": "Tagged unions, also known as sum types or algebraic data types (ADTs), allow a single data structure to hold different types of data. The key idea is that a value can be one of several different types, but the type is always tagged with a label (or tag) to identify which type it currently holds.",

A tagged union is a data structure that can store values of different types, but each value is tagged with a label (type) to indicate its specific form.\n\n2. In Go, you can simulate tagged unions using `structs` and `interfaces`. You define different types and store them in an interface, then use type assertions to extract and work with the underlying types.\n\n3. Drawbacks include boilerplate code, potential runtime errors due to improper type assertions, and lack of exhaustiveness checking when adding new types.\n\n4. Tagged unions are useful when you need to represent multiple types of data under a single variable while maintaining type safety. They are especially beneficial for modeling complex domain concepts.",
