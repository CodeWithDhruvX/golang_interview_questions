These operators work with integers and floating-point numbers.\n\nExample:\n```go\npackage main\nimport \"fmt\"\n\nfunc main() {\n\tfmt.Println(5 + 3)  // Output: 8\n\tfmt.Println(10 - 4) // Output: 6\n\tfmt.Println(2 * 3)  // Output: 6\n\tfmt.Println(10 / 2) // Output: 5\n\tfmt.Println(10 % 3) // Output: 1\n}\n```",
