      "title": "What is Type Conversion?",
      "content": "Type conversion in Go allows you to explicitly convert a variable from one type to another. This is useful when you need to convert between compatible types.\n\nFor example, converting a `float64` to an `int` requires an explicit conversion, like so:\n\n```go\nvar x float64 = 5.6\nvar y int = int(x) // Converts float64 to int\n```",

      "title": "Type Conversion Syntax",

You need to first convert the string to a number using `strconv.Atoi`.\n4. **Use Case for Type Assertion:**\n   Type assertion is used when you need to access the concrete value stored in an `interface{}`.\n   ```go\n   var x interface{} = 42\n   val, ok := x.(int)\n   ```",
