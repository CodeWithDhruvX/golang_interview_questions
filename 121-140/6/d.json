      "title": "Understanding Constraints",
      "content": "A constraint in Go is a type or set of types that restrict the values that a type parameter can take. These constraints are defined using interfaces.\n\nFor example:\n\n```go\ntype Number interface { int | float64 }\n```",

      "title": "Multiple Constraints in a Generic Function",
      "content": "Yes, you can have multiple constraints in a generic function in Go. You can use `type` parameters with multiple constraints by combining them with the `&` operator.\n\nExample:\n\n```go\ntype Adder[T int | float64] interface {\n    Add(a, b T) T\n}\n\nfunc sum[T Adder[T]](a, b T) T {\n    return a.Add(a, b)\n}\n```",

      "title": "How Multiple Constraints Work",
      "content": "When you define multiple constraints, Go ensures that all conditions are met. This allows you to write functions that can operate on types meeting any combination of the constraints.\n\nExample: You can define constraints for both `int` and `float64` types, as seen in the previous example, or create more complex interfaces with multiple methods.",

      "title": "Combining Constraints",
      "content": "In Go 1.18 and later, you can combine multiple constraints using `&` to ensure that the type meets both (or all) conditions.\n\nExample:\n\n```go\ntype Number interface { int | float64 }\ntype Adder interface { Add(a, b Number) Number }\n\nfunc add[T Adder](a, b T) T {\n    return a.Add(a, b)\n}\n```",

      "title": "Limitations of Multiple Constraints",
      "content": "While you can combine constraints, Go's generics system doesn't support all combinations of complex constraints like in some other languages. Each type constraint must be an interface, and the Go syntax has some restrictions.\n\nFor example, you can't create constraints that have completely independent behavior without using interfaces.",

You can combine `Adder` and `Multiplier` constraints.\n\n```go\ntype Multiplier[T any] interface {\n    Multiply(a, b T) T\n}\n\ntype AdderMultiplier[T any] interface {\n    Adder[T]\n    Multiplier[T]\n}\n\nfunc addAndMultiply[T AdderMultiplier[T]](a, b T) (T, T) {\n    return a.Add(a, b), a.Multiply(a, b)\n}\n```",
