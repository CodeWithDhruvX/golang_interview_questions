Generate structured JSON data for the topic: "Do you allow yourself to leave conversations early when overwhelmed?"

Use the following format for each slide:

[
  {
    "title": "<Slide Title>",
    "content": "<Formatted content in markdown if text >",
    "slide_type": "text"
  }
]

Rules:
1. Use slide_type as one of text or table.
2. Use Markdown formatting in content for text slides.
3. For table slides, provide a JSON array of objects representing rows.
4. Keep titles concise and meaningful.
5. Each JSON object should represent one slide.
6. Ensure content is beginner-friendly, structured, and informative.
